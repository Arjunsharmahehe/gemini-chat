## ðŸš€ Key Achievement: Gemma Model Persona Integration

A significant accomplishment of Gemini Chat is the successful implementation of diverse conversation modes for Gemma models. Unlike models that natively support system prompts for persona definition, Gemma models do not. Gemini Chat cleverly bypasses this limitation, enabling engaging and distinct behaviors for Gemma interactions, a feat not easily achieved without direct system prompt support. This means you can chat with "Bro" or "Mukesh" even when using Gemma models!
